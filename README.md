This module reads a [SIMPLE model](https://github.com/SIMPLE-BuildingSimulation/simple_model) and estimates thermodynamic properties. **It is still under development**. Check the documentation [Here](https://simple-buildingsimulation.github.io/heat/rustdoc/doc/heat/index.html)

# Is it accurate?

Check the automatic Validation report [HERE](https://simple-buildingsimulation.github.io/heat/validation/walls.html)

## Some features

* Walls are modelled through Finite Difference method, and the solution is found through a [Runge-Kutta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods)
* Materials are described as they are, the module will choose which ones should be considered no-mass.
* Fenestration and Walls are all treated equally. (Photons don't care whether they are reaching a window or a wall or a door; they just bounce and heat stuff up)
* The temperature of heat zones are updated through [an analytical equation](https://simple-buildingsimulation.github.io/heat/rustdoc/doc/heat/model/struct.ThermalModel.html#method.calculate_zones_abc)

## Get involved!

* **Want to add new features?** Check the docs [HERE](https://simple-buildingsimulation.github.io/heat/rustdoc/doc/heat/index.html) and feel free to create new issues.
* More testing and validation would be great. Check the validation report [HERE](https://simple-buildingsimulation.github.io/heat/)
